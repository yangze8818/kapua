# Running

Kapua can be run in a few different ways. See the following chapters for
more information about how to start and run Kapua.

{% hint style='info' %}
Most of the following descriptions focus on a developer centric
setup and not on a full blown production setup.
{% endhint %}

## Docker containers

Before running Kapua on Docker, you need to 

1. Install docker
1. Run `mvn -f assembly -Pdocker` once to build containers


Now, you can start Kapua by using Docker Compose. To do so, run
  
    kapua/deployments/docker/docker-deploy.sh
    
After Kapua has been started, you can navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080 and log in using the following credentials:
`kapua-sys` : `kapua-password`

You can access the API using: http://localhost:8081

**Note**: If you are using Docker on Windows the hostname will most likely not be `localhost` but
the IP address of your docker instance.

By default, the `latest` version of images will be used. If you want to run some other version of Kapua, set the `IMAGE_VERSION` environment variable, like

    export IMAGE_VERSION=0.2.0
    
To stop Kapua, run
    
    kapua/deployments/docker/docker-undeploy.sh

## OpenShift

OpenShift is a PaaS (Platform As A Service) platform based on Kubernetes. Kapua support deployments into [OpenShift Origin](https://www.openshift.org),
which is an open source community project. Origin sources, can be found [here](https://www.openshift.org/). We support Kapua on OpenShift Origin **1.4.1**.

Currently we support running OpenShift only on Linux OS. If you would like to run Kapua on Mac OS or on Windows for development purposes, please install Linux
(for example Fedora 25) into virtual machine (for example VirtualBox) and install OpenShift there.

### Starting OpenShift cluster

For running Kapua on an OpenShift you need to
have OpenShift cluster installed and started in a first place. You can install it by yourself or rely on the script we provides:

    sudo kapua/deployments/openshift/openshift-start.sh

If you are running your OpenShift cluster for a first time, execute the following initialized script as well:

    kapua/deployments/openshift/openshift-initialize.sh

Initialization script is responsible for logging you into a cluster and creating new OpenShift project for Kapua.

If your Openshift cluster is not on the localhost, set the `OPENSHIFT_HOST` environment variable. For example, something like

    export OPENSHIFT_HOST=192.168.64.2:8443

If for some reasons, you cannot start your cluster, try to execute the startup script with option `DOCKERIZED=FALSE`:

    sudo DOCKERIZED=FALSE kapua/deployments/openshift/openshift-start.sh

Option `DOCKERIZED=FALSE` tells startup script to use standard binary installation of OpenShift Origin instead of Docker-based `oc cluster up` command.

### Deploying Kapua into OpenShift cluster

Now when you have OpenShift cluster up, running and initialized, execute the following script:

    cd kapua/deployments/openshift
    ./openshift-deploy.sh

Now open the following URL in your web browser - `http://localhost:8080`. And log-in into Kapua UI using default
credentials:

<dl>
	<dt>username</dt><dd>kapua-sys</dd>
	<dt>password</dt><dd>kapua-password</dd>
</dl>


## Using Minishift

Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by running a single-node OpenShift cluster inside a VM. Follow [this guide](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html) for installing and having Minishift up and running.

Steps to run Kapua on Minishift are the  following

1. Start Minishift (make sure you have enough memory and cpu resources for your cluster)

    ~~~bash
    minishift start --memory 8GB --cpus 4
    ~~~

2. Export Minishift docker and oc tools

    ~~~bash
    eval $(minishift docker-env)
    eval $(minishift oc-env)
    ~~~

3. Export address of the cluster

    ~~~bash
    export OPENSHIFT_HOST=$(minishift ip):8443
    ~~~

4. Initialize Kapua project

    ~~~bash
    kapua/deployments/openshift/openshift-initialize.sh
    ~~~

5. Deploy Kapua components

    ~~~bash
    cd kapua/deployments/openshift
    ./openshift-deploy.sh
    ~~~

6. Visit Minishift console

    ~~~bash
    minishift dashboard
    ~~~

## Advanced OpenShift configuration

### External Node port for MQTT

The default setup uses port 31883 to export the MQTT over TCP port of the broker. This means that you can connect
from outside of the OpenShift cluster to Kapua over port 31883 (instead of port 1883) to Kapua.

However it is only possible for one service to make use of this port. If you are planning to add a second Kapua installation
and still want to use the external node port, then you will need to choose a different, yet unsed, port.

Also see: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/getting_traffic_into_cluster.html

### Adding metrics

If you have enabled metrics support in OpenShift (e.g. with `oc cluster up --metrics`)
then you can also install Grafana for Hawkular to visualize your data:

    oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hawkular/hawkular-grafana-datasource/master/docker/openshift/openshift-template-ephemeral.yaml

### External access

In order to enable devices to access Kapua we need to allow external access to the broker's MQTT connector. In the default deployment there are two ways to achieve this.

First, the broker exposes MQTT over WebSocket transport. As WebSocket is based on HTTP we can define a router inside the Openshift to get those device connections to the broker.
For example, if your Openshift deployment is running at the address `192.168.64.2`, you can connect the [Kura Simulator](../user-manual/simulator.md) like this

    java -jar target/kapua-simulator-kura-*-SNAPSHOT-app.jar --broker ws://kapua-broker:kapua-password@broker-eclipse-kapua.192.168.64.2.nip.io:80

Not all MQTT clients have WebSocket support, so we need to enable direct MQTT over TCP access to the broker as well. By default, Kapua comes with the NodePort service that routes all traffic from port `31883` to the broker.
So you can connect your MQTT clients directly to this service. For the simulator example similar to the above, that would look something like

    java -jar target/kapua-simulator-kura-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-app.jar --broker tcp://kapua-broker:kapua-password@192.168.64.2:31883

This is suitable only for the local deployments. In the cloud or production environments, you should deploy a proper LoadBalancer Openshift service to enable external traffic flow to the broker.

### Ensuring enough entropy
 
 It may happen that firing up docker containers and starting up application which use
 Java's `SecureRandom` (which happens in the next step a few times) run dry the Linux
 Kernel's entropy pool. The result is that some application will block during startup
 (even longer than 30 seconds) which will trigger OpenShift to kill the pods since they
 are considered unresponsive (which they actually are).
 
 You can check the amount of entropy the kernel has available with the following command:
 
     cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
 
 If this number drops to zero, then the kernel has run out of entropy and application will
 block.
 
 One solution (there are a few others) is to install `haveged` a user-space daemon
 which provides entropy to the kernel.
 
 On CentOS 7 it can be installed with the following commands (all as `root`):
 
     yum install epel-release # only if you 
     yum install haveged
     systemctl enable --now haveged
 
 As the package comes from the [EPEL repositories](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL "Information about EPEL").
 If you haven't yet enabled those repositories, then you need to do this before trying to
 install `haveged`:
 
     yum install epel-release
 
 For more information about `haveged` see http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/
 
 For more information about the "EPEL repositories" see https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL

## Vagrant

Kapua can also be run with Vagrant.

### Installing Vagrant

Before Vargant can be used to run Kapua it needs to be installed. This is different on each distribution.

#### Installing Vagrant on Fedora 25

{% hint style='info' %}
Do not use Vagrant from Fedora 25. Kapua requires to use the VirtualBox provide from Vargant and cannot run
with the `libvirt` provider which Fedora uses. So it is necessary to install Virtualbox and Vagrant from different locations.
{% endhint %} 

Run the following commands in order to install Vagrant (all as `root`):

    dnf install kernel-devel
    
    wget https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc
    rpm --import oracle_vbox.asc
    
    dnf install http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.14/VirtualBox-5.1-5.1.14_112924_fedora25-1.x86_64.rpm
    dnf install https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.2/vagrant_1.9.2_x86_64.rpm

{% hint style='tip' %}
There may by more up to date versions of the binaries. You should check and install more recent versions, if possible.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='danger' %}
By manually installing RPMs you won't receive updates for those packages. You will need to manually check for security updates and bug fixes.
{% endhint %}

### Running Kapua

After Vagrant is installed you can run Kapua by running:

    cd dev-tools/vagrant
    sudo ./start.sh base-box

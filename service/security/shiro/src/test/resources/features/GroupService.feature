Feature: Group Service CRUD tests

  Scenario: Count groups in a blank database
  The default group table must be empty.

    When I count the group entries in the database
    Then I get 0 as result

  Scenario: Regular group in root scope
  Create a regular group entry. The newly created entry must match the
  creator parameters.

    When I configure
      | type    | name                   | value | scopeId | parentScopeId |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  | 1       | 1             |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     | 1       | 1             |
    Given I create the group
      | scope | name        |
      | 1     | test_name_1 |
    Then A group was created
    And The group matches the creator

  Scenario: Regular group in random scope
  Create a regular group entry. The newly created entry must match the
  creator parameters.

    When I configure
      | type    | name                   | value | scopeId | parentScopeId |

    Given I create the group
      | scope | name        |
      | 1234  | test_name_1 |
    Then A group was created
    And The group matches the creator

  Scenario: Duplicate group name in root scope
  Create a regular group entry. The newly created entry must match the
  creator parameters. Try to create a second group entry with the same name.
  An exception should be thrown.

    When I configure
      | type    | name                   | value | scopeId | parentScopeId |

    Given I create the group
      | scope | name        |
      | 0     | test_name_2 |
    Then A group was created
    And The group matches the creator
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaDuplicateNameException" with the text "An entity with the same name test_name_2 already exists."
    When I create the group
      | scope | name        |
      | 0     | test_name_2 |

    Given I create the group
      | scope |
      | 1234  |
    Then An exception was thrown

  Scenario: Update a group entry in the database
  Create a regular group entry. Change the entry name. The updated entry
  parameters should match the original group.

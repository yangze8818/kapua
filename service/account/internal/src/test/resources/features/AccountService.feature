Feature: User Account Service
    The User Account Service is responsible for CRUD operations for user accounts in the Kapua
    database.

Scenario: Handle account creation
    Create a test account and check whether it was created correctly.

    When I create account "test_acc"

    When I create 15 childs for account with Id 1
    Then The account with Id 1 has 15 subaccounts

Scenario: Handle duplicate account names
    Accounts with duplicate names must not be created. When a duplicate account name is
    given, the account service should throw an exception.

    Given An existing account with the name "test_acc_1"
    And I expect the exception "KapuaDuplicateNameException" with the text "An entity with the same name test_acc_1 already exists."
    When I create a duplicate account "test_acc_1"
    Then An exception is caught

Scenario: Handle null account name

    When I create an account with a null name
    Then An exception is caught

Scenario: Find account by Id
    The account service must be able to find the requested account entity by its Id.

     When I search for the account with the remembered account Id
     Then The account matches the creator settings

Scenario: Find account by Ids
    The account service must be able to find the requested account entity by its
    parent and account Ids.

    Given An existing account with the name "test_acc_42"
    When I search for the account with the remembered parent and account Ids
    Then The account matches the creator settings

Scenario: Find account by random Id
    Search for an account that does not exist.

    When I search for a random account Id
    Then The account does not exist

Scenario: Find account by name
    The account service must be able to find the requested account entity by its name.

Scenario: Modify an existing account
    Test that the account service correctly modifies an existing account. The modified
    account details must be correctly stored in the account database.

    Given An existing account with the name "test_acc_42"

    And I modify the current account
    Then An exception is caught

Scenario: Delete an existing account

    And I search for the account with name "test_acc_123"
    Then The account does not exist

Scenario: Delete the Kapua system account
    It must not be possible to delete the system account.

    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalAccessException" with the text "The current subject is not authorized for delete"
    When I try to delete the system account
    Then An exception is caught
    And The System account exists

Scenario: Delete nonexisting account

    When I try to change the account "test_acc_123" scope Id to 2
    Then An exception is caught

    property set to '1' (children of the system account). This is the default query and
    no additional parameter is needed to create it.

    Given I create 9 accounts with organization name "test_org"
    When I query for all accounts that have the system account as parent
    Then The returned value is 9

Scenario: Account service metadata
    The Account service must have some associated configuration metadata. Check that the
    metadata exists. No content checks will be performed.

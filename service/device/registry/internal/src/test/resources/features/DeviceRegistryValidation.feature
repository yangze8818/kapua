Feature: Device Registry Validation Tests
    The Device Registry Validation helper is responsible for validating parameters
    and permissions before any operation is performed on the database.

Scenario: Validate a regular creator
    Create a regular device creator. The validator should OK it.

    Given A regular device creator
    When I validate the device creator
    Then There was no exception

Scenario: Validate a null creator
    Create a null device creator. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given A null device creator
    And I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I validate the device creator
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a device creator with a null scope ID
    Create a regular device creator. Assign a null scope ID. The validator
    should throw an exception.

    Given A regular device creator
    And I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I set the creator scope ID to null
    And I validate the device creator
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a device creator with a null client ID
    Create a regular device creator. Assign a null client ID. The validator
    should throw an exception.

    Given A regular device creator
    And I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I set the creator client ID to null
    And I validate the device creator
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a regular device
    Create a regular device object. the update validator should OK it.

    Given A regular device
    When I validate the device for updates
    Then There was no exception

Scenario: Validate a null device
    Create a null device object. The validator should throw an
    exception.

    Given A null device
    And I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I validate the device for updates
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a regular device search
    Validate the parameters for a device search. Both ScopeID and DeviceID
    are not null. The validator should be OK with it.

    When Validating a find operation for scope 15 and device 4321
    Then There was no exception

Scenario: Validate a device search with a null device ID
    Validate the parameters for a device search. ScopeID is valid, but the DeviceID
    is null. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When Validating a find operation for scope 15 and device null
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a device search with a null scope ID
    Validate the parameters for a device search. DeviceID is valid, but ScopeID
    is null. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When Validating a find operation for scope null and device 2
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a regular device deletion
    Validate the parameters for deleting a device. Both ScopeID and DeviceID
    are not null. The validator should be OK with it.

    When Validating a delete operation for scope 15 and device 4321
    Then There was no exception

Scenario: Validate deleting a device with a null device ID
    Validate the parameters for deleting a device. ScopeID is valid, but the DeviceID
    is null. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When Validating a delete operation for scope 15 and device null
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate deleting a device with a null scope ID
    Validate the parameters for deleting a device. DeviceID is valid, but ScopeID
    is null. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When Validating a delete operation for scope null and device 2
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a regular device client search
    Validate the parameters for a client id based search. Both the Scope ID and the
    Client ID are valid. The validator should OK it.

    When Validating a find operation for scope 42 and client "test_client"
    Then There was no exception

Scenario: Validate a device client search with null scope
    Validate the parameters for a client id based search. The Scope ID is null and the
    Client ID is valid. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When Validating a find operation for scope null and client "test_client"
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a device client based search with a null client ID
    Validate the parameters for a client id based search. The Scope ID is valid but the
    Client ID is null. The validator should throw an exception.
    Note: a string with the content 'null' is taken as a null string. Just a cucumber workaround.

    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When Validating a find operation for scope 42 and client "null"
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a device client based search with an empty client ID
    Validate the parameters for a client id based search. The Scope ID is valid while the
    Client ID is an empty string. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When Validating a find operation for scope 42 and client ""
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a regular device query
    Validate the parameters for a regulat device query. Neither the query nor the query
    Scope ID is null. The validator should be OK with it.

    Given A regular query
    When I validate a query operation
    Then There was no exception

Scenario: Validate a null device query
    Validate a null device query. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given A null query
    And I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I validate a query operation
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a device query with a null Scope ID
    Validate a faulty device query. The query is not null, but the query Scope ID
    is null. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given A query with a null Scope ID
    And I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I validate a query operation
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a regular device count
    Validate the parameters for a regulat device count. Neither the query nor the query
    Scope ID is null. The validator should be OK with it.

    Given A regular query
    When I validate a count operation
    Then There was no exception

Scenario: Validate a null device count
    Validate a device count with a null query. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given A null query
    And I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I validate a count operation
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Validate a device count with a null Scope ID
    Validate a device count with a faulty query. The query is not null, but the query Scope ID is.
    The validator should throw an exception.

    Given A query with a null Scope ID
    And I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I validate a count operation
    Then An exception was raised

Feature: Device Registry Service
    The Device registry Service is responsible for CRUD operations for devices in the Kapua
    database.

Scenario: Create a single device
    Create a single test device. The resulting device must have a unique ID assigned
    by the creation process.

    When I configure
        | type    | name                       | value | scopeId | parentScopeId |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |    1    |       1       |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |    1    |       1       |
    Given A device named "test_device"
    Then The device has a non-null ID

Scenario: All device parameters must match the device creator
    Create a test device and check whether it was created correctly. All the device
    parameters must match the device creator specifications.

    Given A device named "test_device"
    Then The device matches the creator parameters

Scenario: Case sensitivness of named device searches
    Searching by client ID is case sensitive.

    Given A device named "CaseSensitiveTestName"
    Then Named device registry searches are case sesntitive

Scenario: Find device by registry ID
    It must be possible to find a device in the registry by its registry ID.

    Given A device named "TestDevice"
    When I search for a device with the remembered ID
    Then The device matches the creator parameters

Scenario: Find device by client ID
    It must be possible to find a device in the registry by its Client ID.

    Given A device named "TestDevice"
    Then It is possible to find the device based on its client ID

Scenario: Try to find a device with an invalid registry ID
    Searching for a nonexistent device should not raise any exception. Only a null
    device should be returned.

    When I search for a device with a random ID
    Then There is no such device

Scenario: Try to find a device with an invalid client ID
    Searching for a nonexistent device should not raise any exception. Only a null
    device should be returned.

    When I search for a device with a random client ID
    Then There is no such device

Scenario: Device query - find by BIOS version
    It must be possible to construct arbitrary device registry queries. In this case
    several test devices are created with different BIOS version values.
    A query based on the BIOS version must only return the corect device.

    Given A device with BIOS version "1.1.0" named "TestDevice1"
    Given A device with BIOS version "1.2.0" named "TestDevice2"
    Given A device with BIOS version "1.3.0" named "TestDevice3"
    When I query for devices with BIOS version "1.2.0"
    And I extract the first device
    Then The device client id is "TestDevice2"

Scenario: Device queries
    Test several variants of device registry queries.

    Given A device named "TestDevice"
    Given I create 100 randomly named devices with BIOS version "1.1.0"
    Given I create 100 randomly named devices with BIOS version "1.2.0"
    Given I create 100 randomly named devices with BIOS version "1.3.0"
    When I query for devices with BIOS version "1.1.0"
    Then I find 100 devices
    When I query for devices with BIOS version "1.3.0"
    Then I find 100 devices
    When I query for devices with BIOS different from "1.2.0"
    Then I find 201 devices
    When I query for devices with Client Id "TestDevice"
    Then I find 1 device

Scenario: Count devices in a specific scope
    It must be possible to count all the devices in a specific scope.
    To this end several devices are created in 3 different scopes. When
    counted, only the number of devices in the specified scope must be returned.

    When I configure
        | type    | name                       | value | scopeId | parentScopeId |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |    5    |       1       |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 50    |    5    |       1       |
    Given I create 20 randomly named devices in scope 5
    When I configure
        | type    | name                       | value | scopeId | parentScopeId |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |    6    |       1       |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |    6    |       1       |
    Given I create 30 randomly named devices in scope 6
    When I configure
        | type    | name                       | value | scopeId | parentScopeId |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |    7    |       1       |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |    7    |       1       |
    Given I create 45 randomly named devices in scope 7
    When I count the devices in scope 6
    Then There are 30 devices
    When I count the devices in scope 5
    Then There are 20 devices

Scenario: Count devices with a specific BIOS version
    It must be possible to count devices based on arbitrary rules.
    To this end several devices are created with different BIOS version.
    A device count based on the BIOS version value is performed. Only
    the number of devices that match the specified BIOS version is
    returned.

    Given I create 15 randomly named devices with BIOS version "1.1.0"
    Given I create 25 randomly named devices with BIOS version "1.2.0"
    Given I create 35 randomly named devices with BIOS version "1.3.0"
    When I count devices with BIOS version "1.2.0"
    Then There are 25 devices

Scenario: Update an existing device
    Most of the parameters of an existing device are updatable.

    Given A device named "TestDevice"
    When I update some device parameters
    Then The device was correctly updated

Scenario: Try to update the device client ID
    The Client ID of a defice cannot be changed after creation. Any attempt to
    alter this ID must be silently ignored. No exception must be raised.

    Given A device named "TestDevice"
    When I update the device cleint ID to "NewClientId"
    Then The client ID was not changed

Scenario: Update a non existing device
    An attempt to update a non existing device should raise an exception.

    Given A device named "TestDevice"
    And I expect the exception "KapuaEntityNotFoundException" with the text "The entity of type device with id/name"
    When I update a device with an invalid ID
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Delete an existing device from the registry
    It must be possible to delete a device from theregistry. To this
    end a test device is created and subsequently deleted.
    A search for this device should yield a null but no exception.

    Given A device named "TestDevice"
    When I delete the device with the cleint id "TestDevice"
    Then There is no device with the client ID "TestDevice"

Scenario: Try to delete a non existing device from the registry
    If a user tries to delete a non existing device from the registry an
    exception must be raised.

    Given I expect the exception "KapuaEntityNotFoundException" with the text "The entity of type DeviceImpl with id/name"
    When I delete a device with random IDs
    Then An exception was raised

Scenario: Device factory sanity checks
    The Account factory must instantiate and return valid items. For this test it is enough
    that the items returned are not null.

    Then All device factory functions must return non null values

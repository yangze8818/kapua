    Given A mock test step
    Then Nothing happens

Scenario: Regular job execution creation

    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"

    Then No exception was thrown
    And The job execution matches the creator

Scenario: Update job id of an existing execution item

    When I count the execution items for the current job
    Then There are exactly 4 items

Scenario: Query for executions of a specific job

    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob1"

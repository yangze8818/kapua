    Before schema is created methods that search with find for messages, channel info,
    metric info and client info, should return null values.
    Query methods on messages, channel info, metric info and client info should return empty
    results and count on the same services should return 0.
    Delete based on query or parametrized delete on non existent data should not fail. If data
    doesn't exist it is not deleted.

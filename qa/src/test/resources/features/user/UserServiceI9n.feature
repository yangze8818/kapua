  Scenario: Deleting user in account that is lower in hierarchy
  Using user A in in different scope than user B, try to delete user B. Scope of user A is one
  level higher than scope of B. Scope of A is parent of scope B. This allows user A to delete
  user B.
    When I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure account service

    Given I expect the exception "SubjectUnauthorizedException" with the text "Missing permission: user:read:"
    When I try to delete user "kapua-b"
    Then An exception was thrown
    And I logout

  Scenario: Deleting user in account that is higher in hierarchy
  Using user B in in different scope than user A, try to delete user A. Scope of user B is one
  level lower than scope of A. Scope of A is parent of scope B. Subordinate scope should not be
  allowed to delete user in parent scope, unless it has permissions in that scope.

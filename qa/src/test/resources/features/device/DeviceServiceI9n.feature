Scenario: Birth message handling from a new device
    A birth message is received. The referenced device does not yet exist and is created on-the-fly. After the
    message is processed a new device must be created and a BIRTH event inserted in the database.

    When I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    Given Account
